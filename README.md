# Lasers, PEW PEW!

Lasers, PEW PEW! is a small game in Matlab(r), written for the University of Twente course
"Programming in Engineering". The objective is to manipulate various reflective, refractive and
absorbent objects in order to hit a target with a laser. In this way, the game teaches users about
concepts of geometric optics in a playful fashion. 

The simplistic ray tracer implements refractio and both external and internal
reflection.
